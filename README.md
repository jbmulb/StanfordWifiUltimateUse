If you click Sponsored Wireless Guest, you can use the wifi for 5min. Yet, if you click that button again, you can expand the time.

## Main
I think if there is a code that click that button every 5min, then we can use this wifi ultimate.
So, using selenium and time modules, I made a automation code.

## How to use
### Requirement
- Python3
- Selenium
- Chrome
### Run
Just run the py code.

(**Do not quit it after run**)
